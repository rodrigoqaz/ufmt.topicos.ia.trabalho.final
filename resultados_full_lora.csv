we improve the upper bound on the minimal resources required for measurement-based quantum computation. minimizing the resources required for this model is a key issue for experimental realization of a quantum computer based on projective measurements. this new upper bound allows also to reply in the negative to the open question about the existence of a trade-off between observable and ancillary qubits in measurement-based quantum computation.,towards minimal resources of measurement-based quantum computation,minimal resources for measurement-based quantum computation,0.9733559,full_lora
"we present a spitzer based census of the ic 348 nebula and embedded star cluster. our spitzer census supplemented by ground based spectra has added 42 class ii t-tauri sources to the cluster membership and identified ~20 class 0/i protostars. the population of ic 348 likely exceeds 400 sources after accounting statistically for unidentified diskless members. our spitzer census of ic 348 reveals a population of protostars that is anti-correlated spatially with the t-tauri members, which comprise the centrally condensed cluster around a b star. the protostars are instead found mostly at the cluster periphery about 1 pc from the b star and spread out along a filamentary ridge. we find that the star formation rate in this protostellar ridge is consistent with that rate which built the exposed cluster while the presence of fifteen cold, starless, millimeter cores intermingled with this protostellar population indicates that the ic 348 nebula has yet to finish forming stars. we show that the ic 348 cluster is of order 3-5 crossing times old, and, as evidenced by its smooth radial profile and confirmed mass segregation, is likely relaxed. while it seems apparent that the current cluster configuration is the result of dynamical evolution and its primordial structure has been erased, our findings support a model where embedded clusters are built up from numerous smaller sub-clusters. finally, the results of our spitzer census indicate that the supposition that star formation must progress rapidly in a dark cloud should not preclude these observations that show it can be relatively long lived.",a spitzer census of the ic 348 nebula,a spitzer census of the ic 348 nebula,1.0000001,full_lora

"we present the first x-ray detection of the very young pulsar psr j1357-6429 (characteristic age of 7.3 kyr) using data from the xmm-newton and chandra satellites. we find that the spectrum is well described by a power-law plus blackbody model, with photon index gamma=1.4 and blackbody temperature kt=160 ev. for the estimated distance of 2.5 kpc, this corresponds to a 2-10 kev luminosity of about 1.2e+32 erg/s, thus the fraction of the spin-down energy channeled by psr j1357-6429 into x-ray emission is one of the lowest observed. the chandra data confirm the positional coincidence with the radio pulsar and allow to set an upper limit of 3e+31 erg/s on the 2-10 kev luminosity of a compact pulsar wind nebula. we do not detect any pulsed emission from the source and determine an upper limit of 30% for the modulation amplitude of the x-ray emission at the radio frequency of the pulsar.",discovery of x-ray emission from the young radio pulsar psr j1357-6429,the radio pulse from the young pulsar psr j1357-6429: evidence for the existence of a compact stellar wind,0.6300713,full_lora

"we present new observational results obtained for the galactic non-thermal radio source g328.4+0.2 to determine both if this source is a pulsar wind nebula or supernova remnant, and in either case, the physical properties of this source. using x-ray data obtained by xmm, we confirm that the x-ray emission from this source is heavily absorbed and has a spectrum best fit by a power law model of photon index=2 with no evidence for a thermal component, the x-ray emission from g328.4+0.2 comes from a region significantly smaller than the radio emission, and that the x-ray and radio emission are significantly offset from each other. we also present the results of a new high resolution (7 arcseconds) 1.4 ghz image of g328.4+0.2 obtained using the australia telescope compact array, and a deep search for radio pulsations using the parkes radio telescope. we find that the radio emission has a flat spectrum, though some areas along the eastern edge of g328.4+0.2 have a steeper radio spectral index of ~-0.3. additionally, we obtain a luminosity limit of the central pulsar of l_{1400} < 30 mjy kpc^2, assuming a distance of 17 kpc. in light of these observational results, we test if g328.4+0.2 is a pulsar wind nebula (pwn) or a large pwn inside a supernova remnant (snr) using a simple hydrodynamic model for the evolution of a pwn inside a snr. as a result of this analysis, we conclude that g328.4+0.2 is a young (< 10000 years old) pulsar wind nebula formed by a low magnetic field (<10^12 g) neutron star born spinning rapidly (<10 ms) expanding into an undetected snr formed by an energetic (>10^51 ergs), low ejecta mass (m < 5 solar masses) supernova explosion which occurred in a low density (n~0.03 cm^{-3}) environment.","the radio emission, x-ray emission, and hydrodynamics of g328.4+0.2: a comprehensive analysis of a luminous pulsar wind nebula, its neutron star, and the progenitor supernova explosion",new observations of the radio source g328.4+0.2,0.57398576,full_lora

"this article belongs to a series on geometric complexity theory (gct), an approach to the p vs. np and related problems through algebraic geometry and representation theory. the basic principle behind this approach is called the flip. in essence, it reduces the negative hypothesis in complexity theory (the lower bound problems), such as the p vs. np problem in characteristic zero, to the positive hypothesis in complexity theory (the upper bound problems): specifically, to showing that the problems of deciding nonvanishing of the fundamental structural constants in representation theory and algebraic geometry, such as the well known plethysm constants--or rather certain relaxed forms of these decision probelms--belong to the complexity class p. in this article, we suggest a plan for implementing the flip, i.e., for showing that these relaxed decision problems belong to p. this is based on the reduction of the preceding complexity-theoretic positive hypotheses to mathematical positivity hypotheses: specifically, to showing that there exist positive formulae--i.e. formulae with nonnegative coefficients--for the structural constants under consideration and certain functions associated with them. these turn out be intimately related to the similar positivity properties of the kazhdan-lusztig polynomials and the multiplicative structural constants of the canonical (global crystal) bases in the theory of drinfeld-jimbo quantum groups. the known proofs of these positivity properties depend on the riemann hypothesis over finite fields and the related results. thus the reduction here, in conjunction with the flip, in essence, says that the validity of the p vs. np conjecture in characteristic zero is intimately linked to the riemann hypothesis over finite fields and related problems.",geometric complexity theory vi: the flip via saturated and positive integer programming in representation theory and algebraic geometry,flip and the flip for the p vs. np conjecture,0.43777585,full_lora
"the identification of basaltic asteroids in the asteroid main belt and the description of their surface mineralogy is necessary to understand the diversity in the collection of basaltic meteorites. basaltic asteroids can be identified from their visible reflectance spectra and are classified as v-type in the usual taxonomies. in this work, we report visible spectroscopic observations of two candidate v-type asteroids, (7472) kumakiri and (10537) 1991 ry16, located in the outer main belt (a > 2.85 ua). these candidate have been previously identified by roig and gil-hutton (2006, icarus 183, 411) using the sloan digital sky survey colors. the spectroscopic observations have been obtained at the calar alto observatory, spain, during observational runs in november and december 2006. the spectra of these two asteroids show the steep slope shortwards of 0.70 microns and the deep absorption feature longwards of 0.75 microns that are characteristic of v-type asteroids. however, the presence of a shallow but conspicuous absorption band around 0.65 microns opens some questions about the actual mineralogy of these two asteroids. such band has never been observed before in basaltic asteroids with the intensity we detected it. we discuss the possibility for this shallow absorption feature to be caused by the presence of chromium on the asteroid surface. our results indicate that, together with (1459) magnya, asteroids (7472) kumakiri and (10537) 1991 ry16 may be the only traces of basaltic material found up to now in the outer main belt.",two new basaltic asteroids in the outer main belt?,spectroscopic evidence for basaltic minerals in the outer main belt: (1) a search for crh in basaltic asteroids,0.66818416,full_lora

"there is currently a great deal of interest in the theoretical and practical possibility of cloaking objects from the observation by electromagnetic waves. the basic idea of these invisibility devices \cite{glu1, glu2, le},\cite{pss1} is to use anisotropic {\it transformation media} whose permittivity and permeability $\var^{\lambda\nu}, \mu^{\lambda\nu}$, are obtained from the ones, $\var_0^{\lambda\nu}, \mu^{\lambda\nu}_0$, of isotropic media, by singular transformations of coordinates. in this paper we study electromagnetic cloaking in the time-domain using the formalism of time-dependent scattering theory. this formalism allows us to settle in an unambiguous way the mathematical problems posed by the singularities of the inverse of the permittivity and the permeability of the {\it transformation media} on the boundary of the cloaked objects. we write maxwell's equations in schr\""odinger form with the electromagnetic propagator playing the role of the hamiltonian. we prove that the electromagnetic propagator outside of the cloaked objects is essentially self-adjoint. moreover, the unique self-adjoint extension is unitarily equivalent to the electromagnetic propagator in the medium $\var_0^{\lambda\nu}, \mu^{\lambda\nu}_0$. using this fact, and since the coordinate transformation is the identity outside of a ball, we prove that the scattering operator is the identity. our results give a rigorous proof that the construction of \cite{glu1, glu2, le}, \cite{pss1} perfectly cloaks passive and active devices from observation by electromagnetic waves. furthermore, we prove cloaking for general anisotropic materials. in particular, our results prove that it is possible to cloak objects inside general crystals.",a rigorous time-domain analysis of full--wave electromagnetic cloaking (invisibility),"electromagnetic cloaking from the observation of electromagnetic waves by the propagation of waves in the medium $\var_0^{\lambda\nu}, \mu^{\lambda\nu}_0$",0.6694163,full_lora

"(abridged) we compare recent results from x-ray, strong lensing, weak lensing, and optical observations with numerical simulations of the merging galaxy cluster 1e0657-56. x-ray observations reveal a bullet-like subcluster with a prominent bow shock, while lensing results show that the positions of the total mass peaks are consistent with the centroids of the collisionless galaxies (and inconsistent with the x-ray brightness peaks). previous studies, based on older observational datasets, have placed upper limits on the self-interaction cross-section of dark matter per unit mass, sigma/m, using simplified analytic techniques. in this work, we take advantage of new, higher-quality observational datasets by running n-body simulations of 1e0657-56 that include the effects of self-interacting dark matter, and comparing the results with observations. furthermore, the recent data allow for a new independent method of constraining sigma/m, based on the non-observation of an offset between the bullet subcluster mass peak and galaxy centroid. this new method places an upper limit (68% confidence) of sigma/m < 1.25 cm^2/g. if we make the assumption that the subcluster and the main cluster had equal mass-to-light ratios prior to the merger, we derive our most stringent constraint of sigma/m < 0.7 cm^2/g, which comes from the consistency of the subcluster's observed mass-to-light ratio with the main cluster's, and with the universal cluster value, ruling out the possibility of a large fraction of dark matter particles being scattered away due to collisions. our limit is a slight improvement over the previous result from analytic estimates, and rules out most of the 0.5 - 5cm^2/g range invoked to explain inconsistencies between the standard collisionless cold dark matter model and observations.",constraints on the self-interaction cross-section of dark matter from numerical simulations of the merging galaxy cluster 1e 0657-5,the merger of 1e0657-56: constraints on sigma/m from high-resolution numerical simulations,0.4800049,full_lora

"common envelopes form in dynamical time scale mass exchange, when the envelope of a donor star engulfs a much denser companion, and the core of the donor plus the dense companion star spiral inward through this dissipative envelope. as conceived by paczynski and ostriker, this process must be responsible for the creation of short-period binaries with degenerate components, and, indeed, it has proven capable of accounting for short-period binaries containing one white dwarf component. however, attempts to reconstruct the evolutionary histories of close double white dwarfs have proven more problematic, and point to the need for enhanced systemic mass loss, either during the close of the first, slow episode of mass transfer that produced the first white dwarf, or during the detached phase preceding the final, common envelope episode. the survival of long-period interacting binaries with massive white dwarfs, such as the recurrent novae t crb and rs oph, also presents interpretative difficulties for simple energetic treatments of common envelope evolution. their existence implies that major terms are missing from usual formulations of the energy budget for common envelope evolution. the most plausible missing energy term is the energy released by recombination in the common envelope, and, indeed, a simple reformulation the energy budget explicitly including recombination resolves this issue.",common envelope evolution redux,a review of recent evidence for the formation of long-period binary white dwarfs from common envelopes,0.2847663,full_lora
