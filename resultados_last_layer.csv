we improve the upper bound on the minimal resources required for measurement-based quantum computation. minimizing the resources required for this model is a key issue for experimental realization of a quantum computer based on projective measurements. this new upper bound allows also to reply in the negative to the open question about the existence of a trade-off between observable and ancillary qubits in measurement-based quantum computation.,towards minimal resources of measurement-based quantum computation,the minimal resources needed for projective measurements in quantum computers,0.77943444,last_layer
"we present a spitzer based census of the ic 348 nebula and embedded star cluster. our spitzer census supplemented by ground based spectra has added 42 class ii t-tauri sources to the cluster membership and identified ~20 class 0/i protostars. the population of ic 348 likely exceeds 400 sources after accounting statistically for unidentified diskless members. our spitzer census of ic 348 reveals a population of protostars that is anti-correlated spatially with the t-tauri members, which comprise the centrally condensed cluster around a b star. the protostars are instead found mostly at the cluster periphery about 1 pc from the b star and spread out along a filamentary ridge. we find that the star formation rate in this protostellar ridge is consistent with that rate which built the exposed cluster while the presence of fifteen cold, starless, millimeter cores intermingled with this protostellar population indicates that the ic 348 nebula has yet to finish forming stars. we show that the ic 348 cluster is of order 3-5 crossing times old, and, as evidenced by its smooth radial profile and confirmed mass segregation, is likely relaxed. while it seems apparent that the current cluster configuration is the result of dynamical evolution and its primordial structure has been erased, our findings support a model where embedded clusters are built up from numerous smaller sub-clusters. finally, the results of our spitzer census indicate that the supposition that star formation must progress rapidly in a dark cloud should not preclude these observations that show it can be relatively long lived.",a spitzer census of the ic 348 nebula,IC 348: The Early Evolution of an IC Nebula,0.82353246,last_layer

"we present the first x-ray detection of the very young pulsar psr j1357-6429 (characteristic age of 7.3 kyr) using data from the xmm-newton and chandra satellites. we find that the spectrum is well described by a power-law plus blackbody model, with photon index gamma=1.4 and blackbody temperature kt=160 ev. for the estimated distance of 2.5 kpc, this corresponds to a 2-10 kev luminosity of about 1.2e+32 erg/s, thus the fraction of the spin-down energy channeled by psr j1357-6429 into x-ray emission is one of the lowest observed. the chandra data confirm the positional coincidence with the radio pulsar and allow to set an upper limit of 3e+31 erg/s on the 2-10 kev luminosity of a compact pulsar wind nebula. we do not detect any pulsed emission from the source and determine an upper limit of 30% for the modulation amplitude of the x-ray emission at the radio frequency of the pulsar.",discovery of x-ray emission from the young radio pulsar psr j1357-6429,"""X-ray Detection of the Young Pulsar PSR J1357-6429: Characterization of its Spectrum and Luminosity Scale""",0.87728727,last_layer

"we present new observational results obtained for the galactic non-thermal radio source g328.4+0.2 to determine both if this source is a pulsar wind nebula or supernova remnant, and in either case, the physical properties of this source. using x-ray data obtained by xmm, we confirm that the x-ray emission from this source is heavily absorbed and has a spectrum best fit by a power law model of photon index=2 with no evidence for a thermal component, the x-ray emission from g328.4+0.2 comes from a region significantly smaller than the radio emission, and that the x-ray and radio emission are significantly offset from each other. we also present the results of a new high resolution (7 arcseconds) 1.4 ghz image of g328.4+0.2 obtained using the australia telescope compact array, and a deep search for radio pulsations using the parkes radio telescope. we find that the radio emission has a flat spectrum, though some areas along the eastern edge of g328.4+0.2 have a steeper radio spectral index of ~-0.3. additionally, we obtain a luminosity limit of the central pulsar of l_{1400} < 30 mjy kpc^2, assuming a distance of 17 kpc. in light of these observational results, we test if g328.4+0.2 is a pulsar wind nebula (pwn) or a large pwn inside a supernova remnant (snr) using a simple hydrodynamic model for the evolution of a pwn inside a snr. as a result of this analysis, we conclude that g328.4+0.2 is a young (< 10000 years old) pulsar wind nebula formed by a low magnetic field (<10^12 g) neutron star born spinning rapidly (<10 ms) expanding into an undetected snr formed by an energetic (>10^51 ergs), low ejecta mass (m < 5 solar masses) supernova explosion which occurred in a low density (n~0.03 cm^{-3}) environment.","the radio emission, x-ray emission, and hydrodynamics of g328.4+0.2: a comprehensive analysis of a luminous pulsar wind nebula, its neutron star, and the progenitor supernova explosion",Galactic Non-Terrestrial Radio Sources: Observational Evidence and Hydrodynamic Evolution,0.47561318,last_layer

"this article belongs to a series on geometric complexity theory (gct), an approach to the p vs. np and related problems through algebraic geometry and representation theory. the basic principle behind this approach is called the flip. in essence, it reduces the negative hypothesis in complexity theory (the lower bound problems), such as the p vs. np problem in characteristic zero, to the positive hypothesis in complexity theory (the upper bound problems): specifically, to showing that the problems of deciding nonvanishing of the fundamental structural constants in representation theory and algebraic geometry, such as the well known plethysm constants--or rather certain relaxed forms of these decision probelms--belong to the complexity class p. in this article, we suggest a plan for implementing the flip, i.e., for showing that these relaxed decision problems belong to p. this is based on the reduction of the preceding complexity-theoretic positive hypotheses to mathematical positivity hypotheses: specifically, to showing that there exist positive formulae--i.e. formulae with nonnegative coefficients--for the structural constants under consideration and certain functions associated with them. these turn out be intimately related to the similar positivity properties of the kazhdan-lusztig polynomials and the multiplicative structural constants of the canonical (global crystal) bases in the theory of drinfeld-jimbo quantum groups. the known proofs of these positivity properties depend on the riemann hypothesis over finite fields and the related results. thus the reduction here, in conjunction with the flip, in essence, says that the validity of the p vs. np conjecture in characteristic zero is intimately linked to the riemann hypothesis over finite fields and related problems.",geometric complexity theory vi: the flip via saturated and positive integer programming in representation theory and algebraic geometry,Title: Flip Theorem for Decision Problems in Geometric Complexity Theory,0.6546725,last_layer

"context: how planet properties depend on stellar mass is a key diagnostic of planetary formation mechanisms. aims: this motivates planet searches around stars which are significantly more massive or less massive than the sun, and in particular our radial velocity search for planets around very-low mass stars. methods: as part of that program, we obtained measurements of gj 674, an m2.5 dwarf at d=4.5 pc, which have a dispersion much in excess of their internal errors. an intensive observing campaign demonstrates that the excess dispersion is due to two superimposed coherent signals, with periods of 4.69 and 35 days. results: these data are well described by a 2-planet keplerian model where each planet has a ~11 mearth minimum mass. a careful analysis of the (low level) magnetic activity of gj 674 however demonstrates that the 35-day period coincides with the stellar rotation period. this signal therefore originates in a spot inhomogeneity modulated by stellar rotation. the 4.69-day signal on the other hand is caused by a bona-fide planet, gj 674b. conclusion: its detection adds to the growing number of neptune-mass planets around m-dwarfs, and reinforces the emerging conclusion that this mass domain is much more populated than the jovian mass range. we discuss the metallicity distributions of m dwarf with and without planets and find a low 11% probability that they are drawn from the same parent distribution. moreover, we find tentative evidence that the host star metallicity correlates with the total mass of their planetary system.",the harps search for southern extra-solar planets. x. a m sin i = 11 mearth planet around the nearby spotted m dwarf gj 674,Planet Search Around Very-Low Mass Stars,0.44117832,last_layer

"common envelopes form in dynamical time scale mass exchange, when the envelope of a donor star engulfs a much denser companion, and the core of the donor plus the dense companion star spiral inward through this dissipative envelope. as conceived by paczynski and ostriker, this process must be responsible for the creation of short-period binaries with degenerate components, and, indeed, it has proven capable of accounting for short-period binaries containing one white dwarf component. however, attempts to reconstruct the evolutionary histories of close double white dwarfs have proven more problematic, and point to the need for enhanced systemic mass loss, either during the close of the first, slow episode of mass transfer that produced the first white dwarf, or during the detached phase preceding the final, common envelope episode. the survival of long-period interacting binaries with massive white dwarfs, such as the recurrent novae t crb and rs oph, also presents interpretative difficulties for simple energetic treatments of common envelope evolution. their existence implies that major terms are missing from usual formulations of the energy budget for common envelope evolution. the most plausible missing energy term is the energy released by recombination in the common envelope, and, indeed, a simple reformulation the energy budget explicitly including recombination resolves this issue.",common envelope evolution redux,Common Envelopes: A New Perspective,0.6877997,last_layer

"current cone jet algorithms, widely used at hadron colliders, take event particles as seeds in an iterative search for stable cones. a longstanding infrared (ir) unsafety issue in such algorithms is often assumed to be solvable by adding extra `midpoint' seeds, but actually is just postponed to one order higher in the coupling. a proper solution is to switch to an exact seedless cone algorithm, one that provably identifies all stable cones. the only existing approach takes n 2^n time to find jets among n particles, making it unusable at hadron level. this can be reduced to n^2 ln(n) time, leading to code (siscone) whose speed is similar to that of public midpoint implementations. monte carlo tests provide a strong cross-check of an analytical proof of the ir safety of the new algorithm, and the absence of any 'r_{sep}' issue implies a good practical correspondence between parton and hadron levels. relative to a midpoint cone, the use of an ir safe seedless algorithm leads to modest changes for inclusive jet spectra, mostly through reduced sensitivity to the underlying event, and significant changes for some multi-jet observables.",a practical seedless infrared-safe cone jet algorithm,Efficient Cones for Hadron Colliders,0.45395207,last_layer
