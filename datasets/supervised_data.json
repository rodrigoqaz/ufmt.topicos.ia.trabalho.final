{"title": "the evolution of the earth-moon system based on the dark matter field fluid model", "abstract": "the evolution of earth-moon system is described by the dark matter field fluid model proposed in the meeting of division of particle and field 2004, american physical society. the current behavior of the earth-moon system agrees with this model very well and the general pattern of the evolution of the moon-earth system described by this model agrees with geological and fossil evidence. the closest distance of the moon to earth was about 259000 km at 4.5 billion years ago, which is far beyond the roche's limit. the result suggests that the tidal friction may not be the primary cause for the evolution of the earth-moon system. the average dark matter field fluid constant derived from earth-moon system data is 4.39 x 10^(-22) s^(-1)m^(-1). this model predicts that the mars's rotation is also slowing with the angular acceleration rate about -4.38 x 10^(-22) rad s^(-2)."}

{"title": "spectroscopic observations of the intermediate polar ex hydrae in quiescence", "abstract": "results from spectroscopic observations of the intermediate polar (ip) ex hya in quiescence during 1991 and 2001 are presented. spin-modulated radial velocities consistent with an outer disc origin were detected for the first time in an ip. the spin pulsation was modulated with velocities near ~500-600 km/s. these velocities are consistent with those of material circulating at the outer edge of the accretion disc, suggesting corotation of the accretion curtain with material near the roche lobe radius. furthermore, spin doppler tomograms have revealed evidence of the accretion curtain emission extending from velocities of ~500 km/s to ~1000 km/s. these findings have confirmed the theoretical model predictions of king & wynn (1999), belle et al. (2002) and norton et al. (2004) for ex hya, which predict large accretion curtains that extend to a distance close to the roche lobe radius in this system. evidence for overflow stream of material falling onto the magnetosphere was observed, confirming the result of belle et al. (2005) that disc overflow in ex hya is present during quiescence as well as outburst. it appears that the hbeta and hgamma spin radial velocities originated from the rotation of the funnel at the outer disc edge, while those of halpha were produced due to the flow of material along the field lines far from the white dwarf (narrow component) and close to the white dwarf (broad-base component), in agreement with the accretion curtain model."}

{"title": "astrophysical gyrokinetics: kinetic and fluid turbulent cascades in magnetized weakly collisional plasmas", "abstract": "we present a theoretical framework for plasma turbulence in astrophysical plasmas (solar wind, interstellar medium, galaxy clusters, accretion disks). the key assumptions are that the turbulence is anisotropic with respect to the mean magnetic field and frequencies are low compared to the ion cyclotron frequency. the energy injected at the outer scale scale has to be converted into heat, which ultimately cannot be done without collisions. a kinetic cascade develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space and velocity. its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations. in each of the physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematically reduced to a more tractable set of equations. in the \"inertial range\" above the ion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of alfvenic fluctuations, which are governed by the rmhd equations at both the collisional and collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations, which obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associated with the alfvenic component. in the \"dissipation range\" between the ion and electron gyroscales, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-alfven-wave (kaw) cascade governed by two fluid-like electron rmhd equations and a passive phase-space cascade of ion entropy fluctuations. the latter cascade brings the energy of the inertial-range fluctuations that was damped by collisionless wave-particle interaction at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in the phase space and leads to ion heating. the kaw energy is similarly damped at the electron gyroscale and converted into electron heat. kolmogorov-style scaling relations are derived for these cascades. astrophysical and space-physical applications are discussed in detail."}
{"title": "evolution of solitary waves and undular bores in shallow-water flows over a gradual slope with bottom friction", "abstract": "this paper considers the propagation of shallow-water solitary and nonlinear periodic waves over a gradual slope with bottom friction in the framework of a variable-coefficient korteweg-de vries equation. we use the whitham averaging method, using a recent development of this theory for perturbed integrable equations. this general approach enables us not only to improve known results on the adiabatic evolution of isolated solitary waves and periodic wave trains in the presence of variable topography and bottom friction, modeled by the chezy law, but also importantly, to study the effects of these factors on the propagation of undular bores, which are essentially unsteady in the system under consideration. in particular, it is shown that the combined action of variable topography and bottom friction generally imposes certain global restrictions on the undular bore propagation so that the evolution of the leading solitary wave can be substantially different from that of an isolated solitary wave with the same initial amplitude. this non-local effect is due to nonlinear wave interactions within the undular bore and can lead to an additional solitary wave amplitude growth, which cannot be predicted in the framework of the traditional adiabatic approach to the propagation of solitary waves in slowly varying media."}
{"title": "a limit relation for entropy and channel capacity per unit cost", "abstract": "in a quantum mechanical model, diosi, feldmann and kosloff arrived at a conjecture stating that the limit of the entropy of certain mixtures is the relative entropy as system size goes to infinity. the conjecture is proven in this paper for density matrices. the first proof is analytic and uses the quantum law of large numbers. the second one clarifies the relation to channel capacity per unit cost for classical-quantum channels. both proofs lead to generalization of the conjecture."}

{"title": "potassium intercalation in graphite: a van der waals density-functional study", "abstract": "potassium intercalation in graphite is investigated by first-principles theory. the bonding in the potassium-graphite compound is reasonably well accounted for by traditional semilocal density functional theory (dft) calculations. however, to investigate the intercalate formation energy from pure potassium atoms and graphite requires use of a description of the graphite interlayer binding and thus a consistent account of the nonlocal dispersive interactions. this is included seamlessly with ordinary dft by a van der waals density functional (vdw-df) approach [phys. rev. lett. 92, 246401 (2004)]. the use of the vdw-df is found to stabilize the graphite crystal, with crystal parameters in fair agreement with experiments. for graphite and potassium-intercalated graphite structural parameters such as binding separation, layer binding energy, formation energy, and bulk modulus are reported. also the adsorption and sub-surface potassium absorption energies are reported. the vdw-df description, compared with the traditional semilocal approach, is found to weakly soften the elastic response."}

{"title": "the mass and radius of the unseen m-dwarf companion in the single-lined eclipsing binary hat-tr-205-013", "abstract": "we derive masses and radii for both components in the single-lined eclipsing binary hat-tr-205-013, which consists of a f7v primary and a late m-dwarf secondary. the system's period is short, $p=2.230736 \\pm 0.000010$ days, with an orbit indistinguishable from circular, $e=0.012 \\pm 0.021$. we demonstrate generally that the surface gravity of the secondary star in a single-lined binary undergoing total eclipses can be derived from characteristics of the light curve and spectroscopic orbit. this constrains the secondary to a unique line in the mass-radius diagram with $m/r^2$ = constant. for hat-tr-205-013, we assume the orbit has been tidally circularized, and that the primary's rotation has been synchronized and aligned with the orbital axis. our observed line broadening, $v_{\\rm rot} \\sin i_{\\rm rot} = 28.9 \\pm 1.0$ \\kms, gives a primary radius of $r_{\\rm a} = 1.28 \\pm 0.04$ \\rsun. our light curve analysis leads to the radius of the secondary, $r_{\\rm b} = 0.167 \\pm 0.006$ \\rsun, and the semimajor axis of the orbit, $a = 7.54 \\pm 0.30 \\rsun = 0.0351 \\pm 0.0014$ au. our single-lined spectroscopic orbit and the semimajor axis then yield the individual masses, $m_{\\rm b} = 0.124 \\pm 0.010$ \\msun and $m_{\\rm a} = 1.04 \\pm 0.13$ \\msun. our result for hat-tr-205-013 b lies above the theoretical mass-radius models from the lyon group, consistent with results from double-lined eclipsing binaries. the method we describe offers the opportunity to study the very low end of the stellar mass-radius relation."}

{"title": "lagrangian quantum field theory in momentum picture. iv. commutation relations for free fields", "abstract": "possible (algebraic) commutation relations in the lagrangian quantum theory of free (scalar, spinor and vector) fields are considered from mathematical view-point. as sources of these relations are employed the heisenberg equations/relations for the dynamical variables and a specific condition for uniqueness of the operators of the dynamical variables (with respect to some class of lagrangians). the paracommutation relations or some their generalizations are pointed as the most general ones that entail the validity of all heisenberg equations. the simultaneous fulfillment of the heisenberg equations and the uniqueness requirement turn to be impossible. this problem is solved via a redefinition of the dynamical variables, similar to the normal ordering procedure and containing it as a special case. that implies corresponding changes in the admissible commutation relations. the introduction of the concept of the vacuum makes narrow the class of the possible commutation relations; in particular, the mentioned redefinition of the dynamical variables is reduced to normal ordering. as a last restriction on that class is imposed the requirement for existing of an effective procedure for calculating vacuum mean values. the standard bilinear commutation relations are pointed as the only known ones that satisfy all of the mentioned conditions and do not contradict to the existing data."}
{"title": "order of epitaxial self-assembled quantum dots: linear analysis", "abstract": "epitaxial self-assembled quantum dots (saqds) are of interest for nanostructured optoelectronic and electronic devices such as lasers, photodetectors and nanoscale logic. spatial order and size order of saqds are important to the development of usable devices. it is likely that these two types of order are strongly linked; thus, a study of spatial order will also have strong implications for size order. here a study of spatial order is undertaken using a linear analysis of a commonly used model of saqd formation based on surface diffusion. analytic formulas for film-height correlation functions are found that characterize quantum dot spatial order and corresponding correlation lengths that quantify order. initial atomic-scale random fluctuations result in relatively small correlation lengths (about two dots) when the effect of a wetting potential is negligible; however, the correlation lengths diverge when saqds are allowed to form at a near-critical film height. the present work reinforces previous findings about anisotropy and saqd order and presents as explicit and transparent mechanism for ordering with corresponding analytic equations. in addition, saqd formation is by its nature a stochastic process, and various mathematical aspects regarding statistical analysis of saqd formation and order are presented."}

{"title": "dynamical objects for cohomologically expanding maps", "abstract": "the goal of this paper is to construct invariant dynamical objects for a (not necessarily invertible) smooth self map of a compact manifold. we prove a result that takes advantage of differences in rates of expansion in the terms of a sheaf cohomological long exact sequence to create unique lifts of finite dimensional invariant subspaces of one term of the sequence to invariant subspaces of the preceding term. this allows us to take invariant cohomological classes and under the right circumstances construct unique currents of a given type, including unique measures of a given type, that represent those classes and are invariant under pullback. a dynamically interesting self map may have a plethora of invariant measures, so the uniquess of the constructed currents is important. it means that if local growth is not too big compared to the growth rate of the cohomological class then the expanding cohomological class gives sufficient \"marching orders\" to the system to prohibit the formation of any other such invariant current of the same type (say from some local dynamical subsystem). because we use subsheaves of the sheaf of currents we give conditions under which a subsheaf will have the same cohomology as the sheaf containing it. using a smoothing argument this allows us to show that the sheaf cohomology of the currents under consideration can be canonically identified with the derham cohomology groups. our main theorem can be applied in both the smooth and holomorphic setting."}

{"title": "shaping the globular cluster mass function by stellar-dynamical evaporation", "abstract": "we show that the globular cluster mass function (gcmf) in the milky way depends on cluster half-mass density (rho_h) in the sense that the turnover mass m_to increases with rho_h while the width of the gcmf decreases. we argue that this is the expected signature of the slow erosion of a mass function that initially rose towards low masses, predominantly through cluster evaporation driven by internal two-body relaxation. we find excellent agreement between the observed gcmf -- including its dependence on internal density rho_h, central concentration c, and galactocentric distance r_gc -- and a simple model in which the relaxation-driven mass-loss rates of clusters are approximated by -dm/dt = mu_ev ~ rho_h^{1/2}. in particular, we recover the well-known insensitivity of m_to to r_gc. this feature does not derive from a literal ``universality'' of the gcmf turnover mass, but rather from a significant variation of m_to with rho_h -- the expected outcome of relaxation-driven cluster disruption -- plus significant scatter in rho_h as a function of r_gc. our conclusions are the same if the evaporation rates are assumed to depend instead on the mean volume or surface densities of clusters inside their tidal radii, as mu_ev ~ rho_t^{1/2} or mu_ev ~ sigma_t^{3/4} -- alternative prescriptions that are physically motivated but involve cluster properties (rho_t and sigma_t) that are not as well defined or as readily observable as rho_h. in all cases, the normalization of mu_ev required to fit the gcmf implies cluster lifetimes that are within the range of standard values (although falling towards the low end of this range). our analysis does not depend on any assumptions or information about velocity anisotropy in the globular cluster system."}

{"title": "why there is something rather than nothing (out of everything)?", "abstract": "the path integral over euclidean geometries for the recently suggested density matrix of the universe is shown to describe a microcanonical ensemble in quantum cosmology. this ensemble corresponds to a uniform (weight one) distribution in phase space of true physical variables, but in terms of the observable spacetime geometry it is peaked about complex saddle-points of the {\\em lorentzian} path integral. they are represented by the recently obtained cosmological instantons limited to a bounded range of the cosmological constant. inflationary cosmologies generated by these instantons at late stages of expansion undergo acceleration whose low-energy scale can be attained within the concept of dynamically evolving extra dimensions. thus, together with the bounded range of the early cosmological constant, this cosmological ensemble suggests the mechanism of constraining the landscape of string vacua and, simultaneously, a possible solution to the dark energy problem in the form of the quasi-equilibrium decay of the microcanonical state of the universe."}
{"title": "formation of density singularities in ideal hydrodynamics of freely cooling inelastic gases: a family of exact solutions", "abstract": "we employ granular hydrodynamics to investigate a paradigmatic problem of clustering of particles in a freely cooling dilute granular gas. we consider large-scale hydrodynamic motions where the viscosity and heat conduction can be neglected, and one arrives at the equations of ideal gas dynamics with an additional term describing bulk energy losses due to inelastic collisions. we employ lagrangian coordinates and derive a broad family of exact non-stationary analytical solutions that depend only on one spatial coordinate. these solutions exhibit a new type of singularity, where the gas density blows up in a finite time when starting from smooth initial conditions. the density blowups signal formation of close-packed clusters of particles. as the density blow-up time $t_c$ is approached, the maximum density exhibits a power law $\\sim (t_c-t)^{-2}$. the velocity gradient blows up as $\\sim - (t_c-t)^{-1}$ while the velocity itself remains continuous and develops a cusp (rather than a shock discontinuity) at the singularity. the gas temperature vanishes at the singularity, and the singularity follows the isobaric scenario: the gas pressure remains finite and approximately uniform in space and constant in time close to the singularity. an additional exact solution shows that the density blowup, of the same type, may coexist with an \"ordinary\" shock, at which the hydrodynamic fields are discontinuous but finite. we confirm stability of the exact solutions with respect to small one-dimensional perturbations by solving the ideal hydrodynamic equations numerically. furthermore, numerical solutions show that the local features of the density blowup hold universally, independently of details of the initial and boundary conditions."}
{"title": "a universality in pp-waves", "abstract": "we discuss a universality property of any covariant field theory in space-time expanded around pp-wave backgrounds. according to this property the space-time lagrangian density evaluated on a restricted set of field configurations, called universal sector, turns out to be same around all the pp-waves, even off-shell, with same transverse space and same profiles for the background scalars. in this paper we restrict our discussion to tensorial fields only. in the context of bosonic string theory we consider on-shell pp-waves and argue that universality requires the existence of a universal sector of world-sheet operators whose correlation functions are insensitive to the pp-wave nature of the metric and the background gauge flux. such results can also be reproduced using the world-sheet conformal field theory. we also study such pp-waves in non-polynomial closed string field theory (csft). in particular, we argue that for an off-shell pp-wave ansatz with flat transverse space and dilaton independent of transverse coordinates the field redefinition relating the low energy effective field theory and csft with all the massive modes integrated out is at most quadratic in fields. because of this simplification it is expected that the off-shell pp-waves can be identified on the two sides. furthermore, given the massless pp-wave field configurations, an iterative method for computing the higher massive modes using the csft equations of motion has been discussed. all our bosonic string theory analyses can be generalised to the common neveu-schwarz sector of superstrings."}

{"title": "timing and lensing of the colliding bullet clusters: barely enough time and gravity to accelerate the bullet", "abstract": "we present semi-analytical constraint on the amount of dark matter in the merging bullet galaxy cluster using the classical local group timing arguments. we consider particle orbits in potential models which fit the lensing data. {\\it marginally consistent} cdm models in newtonian gravity are found with a total mass m_{cdm} = 1 x 10^{15}msun of cold dm: the bullet subhalo can move with v_{dm}=3000km/s, and the \"bullet\" x-ray gas can move with v_{gas}=4200km/s. these are nearly the {\\it maximum speeds} that are accelerable by the gravity of two truncated cdm halos in a hubble time even without the ram pressure. consistency breaks down if one adopts higher end of the error bars for the bullet gas speed (5000-5400km/s), and the bullet gas would not be bound by the sub-cluster halo for the hubble time. models with v_{dm}~ 4500km/s ~ v_{gas} would invoke unrealistic large amount m_{cdm}=7x 10^{15}msun of cdm for a cluster containing only ~ 10^{14}msun of gas. our results are generalisable beyond general relativity, e.g., a speed of $4500\\kms$ is easily obtained in the relativistic mondian lensing model of angus et al. (2007). however, mondian model with little hot dark matter $m_{hdm} \\le 0.6\\times 10^{15}\\msun$ and cdm model with a small halo mass $\\le 1\\times 10^{15}\\msun$ are barely consistent with lensing and velocity data."}

{"title": "topology change of black holes", "abstract": "the topological structure of the event horizon has been investigated in terms of the morse theory. the elementary process of topological evolution can be understood as a handle attachment. it has been found that there are certain constraints on the nature of black hole topological evolution: (i) there are n kinds of handle attachments in (n+1)-dimensional black hole space-times. (ii) handles are further classified as either of black or white type, and only black handles appear in real black hole space-times. (iii) the spatial section of an exterior of the black hole region is always connected. as a corollary, it is shown that the formation of a black hole with an s**(n-2) x s**1 horizon from that with an s**(n-1) horizon must be non-axisymmetric in asymptotically flat space-times."}

{"title": "circular and non-circular nearly horizon-skimming orbits in kerr spacetimes", "abstract": "we have performed a detailed analysis of orbital motion in the vicinity of a nearly extremal kerr black hole. for very rapidly rotating black holes (spin a=j/m>0.9524m) we have found a class of very strong field eccentric orbits whose angular momentum l_z increases with the orbit's inclination with respect to the equatorial plane, while keeping latus rectum and eccentricity fixed. this behavior is in contrast with newtonian intuition, and is in fact opposite to the \"normal\" behavior of black hole orbits. such behavior was noted previously for circular orbits; since it only applies to orbits very close to the black hole, they were named \"nearly horizon-skimming orbits\". our analysis generalizes this result, mapping out the full generic (inclined and eccentric) family of nearly horizon-skimming orbits. the earlier work on circular orbits reported that, under gravitational radiation emission, nearly horizon-skimming orbits tend to evolve to smaller orbit inclination, toward prograde equatorial configuration. normal orbits, by contrast, always demonstrate slowly growing orbit inclination (orbits evolve toward the retrograde equatorial configuration). using up-to-date teukolsky-fluxes, we have concluded that the earlier result was incorrect: all circular orbits, including nearly horizon-skimming ones, exhibit growing orbit inclination. using kludge fluxes based on a post-newtonian expansion corrected with fits to circular and to equatorial teukolsky-fluxes, we argue that the inclination grows also for eccentric nearly horizon-skimming orbits. we also find that the inclination change is, in any case, very small. as such, we conclude that these orbits are not likely to have a clear and peculiar imprint on the gravitational waveforms expected to be measured by the space-based detector lisa."}

{"title": "symmetry disquisition on the tiox phase diagram", "abstract": "the sequence of phase transitions and the symmetry of in particular the low temperature incommensurate and spin-peierls phases of the quasi one-dimensional inorganic spin-peierls system tiox (tiobr and tiocl) have been studied using inelastic light scattering experiments. the anomalous first-order character of the transition to the spin-peierls phase is found to be a consequence of the different symmetries of the incommensurate and spin-peierls (p$2_{1}/m$) phases. the pressure dependence of the lowest transition temperature strongly suggests that magnetic interchain interactions play an important role in the formation of the spin-peierls and the incommensurate phases. finally, a comparison of raman data on vocl to the tiox spectra shows that the high energy scattering observed previously has a phononic origin."}

{"title": "solar system constraints on gauss-bonnet mediated dark energy", "abstract": "although the gauss-bonnet term is a topological invariant for general relativity, it couples naturally to a quintessence scalar field, modifying gravity at solar system scales. we determine the solar system constraints due to this term by evaluating the post-newtonian metric for a distributional source. we find a mass dependent, 1/r^7 correction to the newtonian potential, and also deviations from the einstein gravity prediction for light-bending. we constrain the parameters of the theory using planetary orbits, the cassini spacecraft data, and a laboratory test of newton's law, always finding extremely tight bounds on the energy associated to the gauss-bonnet term. we discuss the relevance of these constraints to late-time cosmological acceleration."}
{"title": "switching mechanism of photochromic diarylethene derivatives molecular junctions", "abstract": "the electronic transport properties and switching mechanism of single photochromic diarylethene derivatives sandwiched between two gold surfaces with closed and open configurations are investigated by a fully self-consistent nonequilibrium green's function method combined with density functional theory. the calculated transmission spectra of two configurations are strikingly distinctive. the open form lacks any significant transmission peak within a wide energy window, while the closed structure has two significant transmission peaks on the both sides of the fermi level. the electronic transport properties of the molecular junction with closed structure under a small bias voltage are mainly determined by the tail of the transmission peak contributed unusually by the perturbed lowest perturbed unoccupied molecular orbital. the calculated on-off ratio of currents between the closed and open configurations is about two orders of magnitude, which reproduces the essential features of the experimental measured results. moreover, we find that the switching behavior within a wide bias voltage window is extremely robust to both substituting f or s for h or o and varying end anchoring atoms from s to se and te."}

{"title": "the transverse proximity effect in spectral hardness on the line of sight towards he 2347-4342", "abstract": "we report the discovery of 14 quasars in the vicinity of he2347-4342, one of the two quasars whose intergalactic heii forest has been resolved with fuse. by analysing the hi and the heii opacity variations separately, no transverse proximity effect is detected near three foreground quasars of he2347-4342: qsoj23503-4328 (z=2.282, $\\vartheta=3.59$ arcmin), qsoj23500-4319 (z=2.302, $\\vartheta=8.77$ arcmin) and qsoj23495-4338 (z=2.690, $\\vartheta=16.28$ arcmin). this is primarily due to line contamination and overdensities probably created by large-scale structure. by comparing the hi absorption and the corresponding heii absorption, we estimated the fluctuating spectral shape of the extragalactic uv radiation field along this line of sight. we find that the uv spectral shape near he2347-4342 and in the projected vicinity of the three foreground quasars is statistically harder than expected from uv background models dominated by quasars. in addition, we find three highly ionised metal line systems near the quasars. however, they do not yield further constraints on the shape of the ionising field. we conclude that the foreground quasars show a transverse proximity effect that is detectable as a local hardening of the uv radiation field, although the evidence is strongest for qsoj23495-4338. thus, the relative spectral hardness traces the proximity effect also in overdense regions prohibiting the traditional detection in the hi forest. furthermore, we emphasise that softening of quasar radiation by radiative transfer in the intergalactic medium is important to understand the observed spectral shape variations. from the transverse proximity effect of qsoj23495-4338 we obtain a lower limit on the quasar lifetime of ~25 myr."}

{"title": "the reliability on the direction of the incident neutrino for the fully contained events and partially contained events due to qel in the super-kamiokande", "abstract": "in the sk analysis of the neutrino events for [fully contained events] and [partially contained events] on their zenith angle distribution, it is assumed that the zenith angle of the incident neutrino is the same as that of the detected charged lepton. in the present paper, we examine the validity of [the sk assumption on the direction] of the incident neutrinos. concretely speaking, we analyze muon-like events due to qel. for the purpose, we develop [time sequential monte carlo simulation] to extract the conclusion on the validity of the sk assumption. in our [time sequential simulation], we simulate every physical process concerned as exactly as possible without any approximation. from the comparison between the zenith angle distributon of the emitted muons under [the sk assumption on the direction] and the corresponding one obtained under our [time sequential simulation], it is concluded that the measurement of the direction of the incident neutrino for the neutrino events occurring inside the detector in the sk analysis turns out to be unreliable, which holds irrespective of the existence and/or non-existence of the neutrino oscillation."}
{"title": "intricate knots in proteins: function and evolution", "abstract": "a number of recently discovered protein structures incorporate a rather unexpected structural feature: a knot in the polypeptide backbone. these knots are extremely rare, but their occurrence is likely connected to protein function in as yet unexplored fashion. our analysis of the complete protein data bank reveals several new knots which, along with previously discovered ones, can shed light on such connections. in particular, we identify the most complex knot discovered to date in human ubiquitin hydrolase, and suggest that its entangled topology protects it against unfolding and degradation by the proteasome. knots in proteins are typically preserved across species and sometimes even across kingdoms. however, we also identify a knot which only appears in some transcarbamylases while being absent in homologous proteins of similar structure. the emergence of the knot is accompanied by a shift in the enzymatic function of the protein. we suggest that the simple insertion of a short dna fragment into the gene may suffice to turn an unknotted into a knotted structure in this protein."}

{"title": "quantum mechanical approach to decoherence and relaxation generated by fluctuating environment", "abstract": "we consider an electrostatic qubit, interacting with a fluctuating charge of single electron transistor (set) in the framework of exactly solvable model. the set plays a role of the fluctuating environment affecting the qubit's parameters in a controllable way. we derive the rate equations describing dynamics of the entire system for both weak and strong qubit-set coupling. solving these equation we obtain decoherence and relaxation rates of the qubit, as well as the spectral density of the fluctuating qubit's parameters. we found that in the weak coupling regime the decoherence and relaxation rates are directly related to the spectral density taken at rabi or at zero frequency, depending on what a particular qubit's parameters is fluctuating. this relation holds also in the presence of weak back-action of the qubit on the fluctuating environment. in the case of strong back-action, such simple relationship no longer holds, even if the qubit-set coupling is small. it does not hold either in the strong-coupling regime, even in the absence of the back-action. in addition, we found that our model predicts localization of the qubit in the strong-coupling regime, resembling that of the spin-boson model."}

{"title": "analysis of random boolean networks using the average sensitivity", "abstract": "in this work we consider random boolean networks that provide a general model for genetic regulatory networks. we extend the analysis of james lynch who was able to proof kauffman's conjecture that in the ordered phase of random networks, the number of ineffective and freezing gates is large, where as in the disordered phase their number is small. lynch proved the conjecture only for networks with connectivity two and non-uniform probabilities for the boolean functions. we show how to apply the proof to networks with arbitrary connectivity $k$ and to random networks with biased boolean functions. it turns out that in these cases lynch's parameter $\\lambda$ is equivalent to the expectation of average sensitivity of the boolean functions used to construct the network. hence we can apply a known theorem for the expectation of the average sensitivity. in order to prove the results for networks with biased functions, we deduct the expectation of the average sensitivity when only functions with specific connectivity and specific bias are chosen at random."}
